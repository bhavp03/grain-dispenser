# grain-dispenser
Our visionary iteration was to make a fully automatic
IOT-based sustainable and zero-waste machine. The
machine will be easy to use just as a vending
machine. So, our machine will be filled with
different types of flour/grains, the consumer has to
bring his/her container. The bottom part of the
container will work as a dispensing mouth of the
machine, fitted with a screw shaft to control the
flow of the grains/flours. The shaft is driven by
stepper motor controlled by a STM32
microcontroller. The rigid structure of the model
provides for stability under process.
